Modeling of Interactions between BCSC and Microenvironment: Predicting State Transitions

We used various methods to simulate the transition of Breast Cancer Stem Cells between various states of growth and proliferation.

The seed data is described in this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6322404/.

The code that has been documented in this project is one part of a larger collaborative effort between myself, 
Ashvath Balgovind, Rose Rao, and Paula Pedrani under the Wollman Lab at the UCLA department of integrative physiology.
